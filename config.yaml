    content: |-
      I am a Software Engineer with a passion for building helpful and beautiful programs. I can typically be found learning something new, building a new project, or gaming. I actually find some coding challenges fun/relaxing (looking at you Advent of Code), so I don't think anyone is ever surprised to see me tackling a new puzzle.
